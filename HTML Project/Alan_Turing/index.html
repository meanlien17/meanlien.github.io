    <b>Alan Mathison Turing </b>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire" >
      <abbr title="Officer of the Order of the British Empire">OBE</abbr>
    </a>
    (23 June 1912 - 7 June 1954) was a pioneering English
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist">computer scientist</a>
    mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and theoretical biologist. He was highly
    influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a
    formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine,
    which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is
    widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS)
    at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre. For a time he led Hut 8, the section
    responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for
    breaking German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method
    and an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.
    Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled
    the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle
    of the Atlantic; it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by as many as four years.
    After the war, he worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the ACE,
    among the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman's
    Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped
    develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He
    wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis, and predicted oscillating chemical
    reactions such as the Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.<P>
      Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when such behaviour was still a criminal
      act in the UK. He accepted treatment with DES (chemical castration) as an alternative to prison.
      Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest
      determined his death as suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is equally
      consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British
      Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government
      for "the appalling way he was treated." Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013.

    <p>Turing was born in Maida Vale, London, while his father, Julius Mathison Turing (1873-1947),
      was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service(ICS) at Chhatrapur, Bihar and Orissa Province,
      in British India.

    <p>Turing's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a day school at 20 Charles Road, at the age of six.
      The headmistress recognised his talent early on, as did many of his subsequent educators. In 1926,
      at the age of 13, he went on to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherborne_School">Sherborne School</a>,
      an independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset.

    <p>At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom, who has been
      described as Turing's "first love". Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavers,
      but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930, from complications.

      During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at
      Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said, "You needed exceptional
      talent, you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing's was that genius."[45] From September 1938,
      Turing had been working part-time with the GC&CS, the British code breaking organisation. He
      concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma, with Dilly Knox, a senior GC&CS codebreaker.
