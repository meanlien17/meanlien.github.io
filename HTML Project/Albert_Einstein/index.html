    <b>Albert Einstein </b>
    ( 14 March 1879 - 18 April 1955)<br>
    was a German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the general theory of relativity, one of the
    two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). Einstein's work is also known
    for its influence on the philosophy of science. Einstein is best known in popular culture for
    his mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc<sup>2</sup> (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation").
    He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his "services to theoretical physics", in particular
    his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory.
  </p>
  <p>
    Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to
    reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led to the
    development of his special theory of relativity. He realized, however, that the principle of relativity
    could also be extended to gravitational fields, and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916,
    he published a paper on general relativity. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics
    and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He
    also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of
    light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the large-scale structure
    of the universe.
  </p>
  <p>
    He was visiting the United States when Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933 and, being Jewish, did not
    go back to Germany, where he had been a professor at the Berlin Academy of Sciences. He settled in the
    U.S., becoming an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to
    President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential development of "extremely powerful bombs
    of a new type" and recommending that the U.S. begin similar research. This eventually led to what would
    become the Manhattan Project. Einstein supported defending the Allied forces, but largely denounced the
    idea of using the newly discovered nuclear fission as a weapon. Later, with the British philosopher
    Bertrand Russell, Einstein signed the Russell-Einstein Manifesto, which highlighted the danger of
    nuclear weapons. Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey,
    until his death in 1955.
  </p>
  <p>
    Einstein published more than 300 scientific papers along with over 150 non-scientific works.
    On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the release of Einstein's papers,
    comprising more than 30,000 unique documents. Einstein's intellectual achievements and
    originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".

  <p>
    Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Wurttemberg in the German Empire on 14 March 1879.
    His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family
    moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J.
    Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Einsteins were non-observant Ashkenazi Jews, and Albert attended a Catholic elementary school
    in Munich from the age of 5 for three years. At the age of 8, he was transferred to the Luitpold
    Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and
    secondary school education until he left the German Empire seven years later.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical
    lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC)
    standard to the more efficient alternating current (AC) standard. The loss forced the sale of
    the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and
    a few months later to Pavia. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to finish
    his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering,
    but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He
    later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning. At
    the end of December 1894, he travelled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school
    to let him go by using a doctor's note. During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the
    title "On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field".
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein sat the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic
    in Zurich (later the Eidgen&#246;ssische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required
    standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades in physics
    and mathematics. On the advice of the principal of the Polytechnic, he attended the Argovian
    cantonal school (gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895-96 to complete his secondary schooling.
    While lodging with the family of professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter,
    Marie. (Albert's sister Maja later married Winteler's son Paul.) In January 1896, with his
    father's approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of W&#252;rttemberg to
    avoid military service. In September 1896, he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades,
    including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1-6. Though only
    17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Z&#252;rich
    Polytechnic. Marie Winteler moved to Olsberg, Switzerland, for a teaching post.
  </p>
  <p>
    Einstein's future wife, Mileva Mari&#263;, also enrolled at the Polytechnic that year. She was the only
    woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course.
    Over the next few years, Einstein and Mari&#263;'s friendship developed into romance, and they read
    books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest.
    In 1900, Einstein was awarded the &#252;rich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Mari&#263; failed the
    examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions. There have
    been claims that Mari&#263; collaborated with Einstein on his celebrated 1905 papers, but
    historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive
    contributions.
    <p>



      <h2 id="marriages_and_children">Marriages and Children</h2>
      <p>The discovery and publication in 1987 of an early correspondence between Einstein and Maric
        revealed that they had had a daughter, called "Lieserl" in their letters, born in early 1902
        in Novi Sad where Maric was staying with her parents. Maric returned to Switzerland without
        the child, whose real name and fate are unknown. Einstein probably never saw his daughter.
        The contents of his letter to Maric in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either
        adopted or died of scarlet fever in infancy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Einstein and Maric married in January 1903. In May 1904, their first son, Hans Albert
        Einstein, was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their second son, Eduard, was born in Zurich
        in July 1910. In April they moved to Berlin. After a few months his wife returned to
        Zurich with their sons, after learning that Einstein's chief romantic attraction was
        his first and second cousin Elsa. They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived
        apart for five years. Eduard, whom his father called "Tete" (for petit), had a
        breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared
        for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally being
        Committed permanently after her death.
      </p>
      <p>
        In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love, Marie Winteler,
        about his marriage and his still-strong feelings for Marie. In 1910 he wrote to
        her that "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy
        as only a man can be" while his wife was pregnant with their second child. Einstein
        spoke about a "misguided love" and a "missed life" regarding his love for Marie.
      </p>
      <p>
        Einstein married Elsa Lowenthal on 2 June 1919, after having had a relationship
        with her since 1912. She was a first cousin maternally and a second cousin paternally.
        In 1933, they emigrated to the United States. In 1935, Elsa Einstein was diagnosed
        with heart and kidney problems; she died in December 1936
