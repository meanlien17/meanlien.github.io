        <b>John von Neumann</b> (December 28, 1903 - February 8, 1957) was a Hungarian-American pure and applied mathematician, physicist,
        inventor, computer scientist, and polymath. He made major contributions to a number of fields, including mathematics, (functional analysis, ergodic theory,
        geometry, topology, and numerical analysis), physics(quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics, and quantum statistical mechanics),
        economics (game theory), computing (Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing), and statistics.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics, in the development of functional analysis, and a key figure in the
        development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer. He published 150 papers
        in his life: 60 in pure mathematics, 20 in physics, and 60 in applied mathematics. His last work, an unfinished manuscript written while in
        the hospital, was later published in book form as The Computer and the Brain.
      </p>
      <p>
        His mathematical analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. In a short list of
        facts about his life he submitted to the National Academy of Sciences, he stated "The part of my work I consider most essential is
        that on quantum mechanics, which developed in Gottingen in 1926, and subsequently in Berlin in 1927-1929. Also, my work on various
        forms of operator theory, Berlin 1930 and Princeton 1935-1939; on the ergodic theorem, Princeton, 1931-1932."
      </p>
      <p>
        During World War II he worked on the Manhattan Project, developing the mathematical models behind the explosive lenses used in the
        implosion-type nuclear weapon. After the war, he served on the General Advisory Committee of the United States Atomic Energy
        Commission, and later as one of its commissioners. He was a consultant to a number of organizations, including the
        United States Air Force, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
        Along with theoretical physicist Edward Teller, mathematician Stanislaw Ulam, and others, he worked out key steps in the
        nuclear physics involved in thermonuclear reactions and the hydrogen bomb.

      <p>Von Neumann was born Neumann Janos Lajos to wealthy Jewish parents of the Haskalah
        (in Hungarian the family name comes first and his given names equate to John Lewis in English).
        His Hebrew name was Yonah. Von Neumann's place of birth was Budapest in the Kingdom of
        Hungary which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was the eldest of
        three children. He had two younger brothers: Michael, born in 1907, and Nicholas, who was
        born in 1911. His father, Neumann Miksa (English: Max Neumann) was a banker, who held a
        doctorate in law. He had moved to Budapest from Pécs at the end of the 1880s. Miksa's
        father and grandfather were both born in Ond (now part of the town of Szerencs), Zemplén
        County, northern Hungary. John's mother was Kann Margit (English: Margaret Kann);
        her parents were Jakab Kann and Katalin Meisels. Three generations of the Kann
        family lived in spacious apartments above the Kann-Heller offices in Budapest; von
        Neumann's family occupied an 18-room apartment on the top floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1913, his father was elevated to the nobility for his service to the Austro-Hungarian
        Empire by Emperor Franz Joseph. The Neumann family thus acquired the hereditary appellation
        Margittai, meaning of Marghita. The family had no connection with the town; the appellation
        was chosen in reference to Margaret, as was those chosen coat of arms depicting three
        marguerites. Neumann János became Margittai Neumann Janos (John Neumann of Marghita),
        which he later changed to the German Johann von Neumann.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formal schooling did not start in Hungary until the age of ten. Instead, governesses
        taught von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins. Max believed that knowledge of languages
        other than Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French,
        German and Italian. By the age of 8, von Neumann was familiar with differential and
        integral calculus, but he was particularly interested in history, reading his way
        through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen. A
        copy was contained in a private library Max purchased. One of the rooms in the apartment
        was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Von Neumann entered the Lutheran Fasori Evangelikus Gimnazium in 1911. This was one of
        the best schools in Budapest, part of a brilliant education system designed for the elite.
        Under the Hungarian system, children received all their education at the one gymnasium.
        Despite being run by the Lutheran Church, the majority of its pupils were Jewish. The
        school system produced a generation noted for intellectual achievement, that included
        Theodore von Karman (b. 1881), George de Hevesy (b. 1885), Leo Szilard (b. 1898), Eugene
        Wigner (b. 1902), Edward Teller (b. 1908), and Paul Erdos (b. 1913). Collectively,
        they were sometimes known as Martians. Wigner was a year ahead of von Neumann at the
        Lutheran School. When asked why the Hungary of his generation had produced so many
        geniuses, Wigner, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, replied that von Neumann
        was the only genius.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Max insisted von Neumann attend school at the grade level appropriate to his age,
        he agreed to hire private tutors to give him advanced instruction in those areas in which
        he had displayed an aptitude. At the age of 15, he began to study advanced calculus under
        the renowned analyst Gabor Szego. On their first meeting, Szego was so astounded with
        the boy's mathematical talent that he was brought to tears. Some of von Neumann's instant
        solutions to the problems in calculus posed by Szego, sketched out on his father's stationery,
        are still on display at the von Neumann archive in Budapest. By the age of 19, von Neumann
        had published two major mathematical papers, the second of which gave the modern definition
        of ordinal numbers, which superseded Georg Cantor's definition. At the conclusion of
        his education at the gymnasium, von Neumann sat for and won the Eotvos Prize, a national
        prize for mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since there were few posts in Hungary for mathematicians, and those were not well-paid,
        his father wanted von Neumann to follow him into industry and therefore invest his time
        in a more financially useful endeavor than mathematics. Von Neumann and his father decided
        that the best career path was to become a chemical engineer. This was not something that
        von Neumann had much knowledge of, so it was arranged for him to take a two-year non-degree
        course in chemistry at the University of Berlin, after which he sat the entrance exam to
        the prestigious ETH Zurich, which he passed in September 1923. At the same time,
        von Neumann also entered Pazmany Peter University in Budapest, as a Ph.D. candidate
        in mathematics. For his thesis, he chose to produce an axiomatization of Cantor's set
        theory. He passed his final examinations for his Ph.D. soon after graduating
        from ETH Zurich in 1926. He then went to the University of Gottingen on a grant from
        the Rockefeller Foundation to study mathematics under David Hilbert.

        Von Neumann's habilitation was completed on December 13, 1927, and he started his
        lectures as a privatdozent at the University of Berlin in 1928. By the end of
        1927, von Neumann had published twelve major papers in mathematics, and by the end
        of 1929, thirty-two papers, at a rate of nearly one major paper per month.
        His reputed powers of memorization and recall allowed him to quickly memorize a
        column from the telephone book and recite the names. In 1929, he briefly
        became a privatdozent at the University of Hamburg, where the prospects of
        becoming a tenured professor were better, but in October of that year a
        better offer presented itself when he was invited to Princeton University in
        Princeton, New Jersey.
      </p>
      <p>
        On New Year's Day in 1930, von Neumann married Mariette Kovesi, who had studied
        economics at the Budapest University. Before his marriage he was baptized a
        Catholic. Max had died in 1929. None of the family had converted to Christianity
        while he was alive, but afterwards they all did. Von Neumann and Mariette
        had one child, a daughter, Marina, who as of 2015 is a distinguished professor
        of business administration and public policy at the University of Michigan.
        The couple divorced in 1937. In October 1938, von Neumann married Klara Dan,
        whom he had met during his last trips back to Budapest prior to the outbreak of
        World War II.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1933, von Neumann was offered a lifetime professorship on the faculty of the
        Institute for Advanced Study when the institute's plan to appoint Hermann Weyl fell
        through. He remained a mathematics professor there until his death, although he
        announced his intention to resign and become a professor at large at the University
        of California shortly before. His mother, brothers and in-laws followed von
        Neumann to the United States in 1939. Von Neumann anglicized his first name to
        John, keeping the German-aristocratic surname of von Neumann. His brothers changed
        theirs to "Neumann" and "Vonneumann". Von Neumann became a naturalized citizen
        of the United States in 1937, and immediately tried to become a lieutenant in the
        United States Army's Officers Reserve Corps. He passed the exams easily, but was
        ultimately rejected because of his age. His prewar analysis of how France would
        stand up to Germany is often quoted. He said: "Oh, France won't matter."
      </p>
      <p>
        The von Neumanns, Klara and John, were active socially within the Princeton
        academic community. His white clapboard house at 26 Westcott Road was one of the
        largest in Princeton. He took great care over his clothing, and would always
        wear formal suits, once riding down the Grand Canyon astride a mule in a
        three-piece pin-stripe. Hilbert is reported to have asked at von Neumann's
        1926 doctoral exam: "Pray, who is the candidate's tailor?" as he had never
        seen such beautiful evening clothes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Von Neumann liked to eat and drink; his wife, Klara, said that he could
        count everything except calories. He enjoyed Yiddish and "off-color"
        humor (especially limericks). He was a non-smoker. At Princeton
        he received complaints for regularly playing extremely loud German
        march music on his gramophone, which distracted those in neighbouring
        offices, including Albert Einstein, from their work. Von Neumann
        did some of his best work in noisy, chaotic environments, and once
        admonished his wife for preparing a quiet study for him to work in.
        He never used it, preferring the couple's living room with its television
        playing loudly. Despite being a notoriously bad driver, he nonetheless
        enjoyed driving-frequently while reading a book-occasioning numerous arrests,
        as well as accidents. When Cuthbert Hurd hired him as a consultant to
        IBM, Hurd often quietly paid the fines for his traffic tickets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Von Neumann's closest friend in the United States was mathematician
        Stanislaw Ulam. A later friend of Ulam's, Gian-Carlo Rota, wrote:
        "They would spend hours on end gossiping and giggling, swapping Jewish
        jokes, and drifting in and out of mathematical talk." When von Neumann
        was dying in hospital, every time Ulam would visit he would come
        prepared with a new collection of jokes to cheer up his friend. He
        believed that much of his mathematical thought occurred intuitively,
        and he would often go to sleep with a problem unsolved, and know the
        answer immediately upon waking up.

      <h3 id="set_theory">Set Theory</h3>
      <p>
        The axiomatization of mathematics, on the model of Euclid's Elements,
        had reached new levels of rigour and breadth at the end of the 19th
        century, particularly in arithmetic, thanks to the axiom schema of
        Richard Dedekind and Charles Sanders Peirce, and geometry, thanks to
        Hilbert's axioms. But at the beginning of the 20th century,
        efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback
        due to Russell's paradox (on the set of all sets that do not belong
        to themselves). The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set
        theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst
        Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory provided a
        series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets
        used in the everyday practice of mathematics, but they did not
        explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that
        belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann
        demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets—the axiom of
        foundation and the notion of class.
      </p>
      <p>
        The axiom of foundation proposed that every set can be constructed
        from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps by way of the
        principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel. If one set belongs to another then
        the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession.
        This excludes the possibility of a set belonging to itself. To
        demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not
        produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of
        demonstration, called the method of inner models, which later became
        an essential instrument in set theory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second approach to the problem of sets belonging to themselves
        took as its base the notion of class, and defines a set as a class
        which belongs to other classes, while a proper class is defined as a
        class which does not belong to other classes. Under the
        Zermelo-Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set
        of all sets which do not belong to themselves. In contrast, under the
        von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which do not belong to
        themselves can be constructed, but it is a proper class and not a set.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this contribution of von Neumann, the axiomatic system of the
        theory of sets avoided the contradictions of earlier systems, and
        became usable as a foundation for mathematics, despite the lack of a
        proof of its consistency. The next question was whether it provided
        definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be posed
        in it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms that
        could be used to prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly
        negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930
        at the historic mathematical Congress of Konigsberg, in which Kurt
        Godel announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual
        axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove
        every truth which is expressible in their language. Moreover, every
        consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain
        incomplete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Less than a month later, von Neumann, who had participated at the
        Congress, communicated to Godel an interesting consequence of his
        theorem: that the usual axiomatic systems are unable to demonstrate
        their own consistency. However, Godel had already discovered this
        consequence, now known as his second incompleteness theorem, and he
        sent von Neumann a preprint of his article containing both
        incompleteness theorems. Von Neumann acknowledged Godel's priority in
        his next letter. He never thought much of "the American system of
        claiming personal priority for everything."
      </p>

      <h3 id="ergodic_theory">Ergodic Theory</h3>
      <p>
        Von Neumann made foundational contributions to ergodic theory, in a
        series of articles published in 1932.Of the 1932 papers on
        ergodic theory, Paul Halmos writes that even "if von Neumann had
        never done anything else, they would have been sufficient to guarantee
        him mathematical immortality". By then von Neumann had already
        written his famous articles on operator theory, and the application
        of this work was instrumental in the von Neumann mean ergodic
        theorem.
      </p>
      <h3 id="operator_theory">Operator Theory</h3>
      <p>
        Von Neumann introduced the study of rings of operators, through the
        von Neumann algebras. A von Neumann algebra is a *-algebra of bounded
        operators on a Hilbert space that is closed in the weak operator
        topology and contains the identity operator. The von Neumann
        bicommutant theorem shows that the analytic definition is equivalent
        to a purely algebraic definition as an algebra of symmetries. The
        direct integral was introduced in 1949 by John von Neumann. One of von
        Neumann's analyses was to reduce the classification of von Neumann
        algebras on separable Hilbert spaces to the classification of factors.
      </p>
      <h3 id="measure_theory">Measure Theory</h3>
      <p>
        In measure theory, the "problem of measure" for an n-dimensional
        Euclidean space Rn may be stated as: "does there exist a positive,
        normalized, invariant, and additive set function on the class of all
        subsets of Rn?" The work of Felix Hausdorff and Stefan Banach had
        implied that the problem of measure has a positive solution if n = 1
        or n = 2 and a negative solution (because of the Banach-Tarski
        paradox) in all other cases. Von Neumann's work argued that the
        "problem is essentially group-theoretic in character": the
        existence of a measure could be determined by looking at the
        properties of the transformation group of the given space. The
        positive solution for spaces of dimension at most two, and the
        negative solution for higher dimensions, comes from the fact that the
        Euclidean group is a solvable group for dimension at most two, and is
        not solvable for higher dimensions. "Thus, according to von Neumann,
        it is the change of group that makes a difference, not the change of
        space."
      </p>
      <p>
        In a number of von Neumann's papers, the methods of argument he
        employed are considered even more significant than the results. In
        nticipation of his later study of dimension theory in algebras of
        operators, von Neumann used results on equivalence by finite
        decomposition, and reformulated the problem of measure in terms of
        functions. In his 1936 paper on analytic measure theory, he used
        the Haar theorem in the solution of Hilbert's fifth problem in the
        case of compact groups. In 1938, he was awarded the Bocher
        Memorial Prize for his work in analysis.
